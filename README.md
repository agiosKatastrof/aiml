# Anaconda
Anaconda is a packaged suite of tools related to machine learning.  
It comes with a distribution of python and AI/ML libs
https://anaconda.com
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
You can use any OS, but Linux seems best

# Jupyter
Jupyter is browser based tool for experimental coding.   It is often used in machine learning, but can be used in general when testing out snippets of code.

Jupyter can be used outside anaconda, but anaconda will install jupyter for your

https://jupyter.org/

# IDE
You don't actually have to use Jupyter, but it makes it easier.  Using Jupyter, you actually don't need an IDE

If you choose to use an IDE, you can use pycharm (for linux mint below)

# Source Control
Use git - and link it to github.
If you aren't using an IDE, you can do this via command line.  In general, command line git is more effecient.

# you need local git client
https://git-scm.com/downloads
#launch jupyter from command line
$ jupyter notebook
open via http link in logs, with token

# browse to git location via jupyter
use jupyter as an ide, or cmd ine
click 'new' upper right to start a new file - choose python3
use cmdline git or pycharms git integration to source control with github

quick jupyter keyboard shortcuts
cntrl-s save cell
cntrl-enter run the cell

# use scikit, one of the more commont ML libs
